                       Secure Credential Transfer
                 draft-securecredential-transfer-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism to transfer digital credentials
   securely between two devices Secure credentials may represent a
   digital key to a hotel room, a digital key to a door lock in a house
   or a digital key to a car.  Devices that share credentials may belong
   to the same or two different platforms (e.g. iOS and Android).
   Secure transfer may include one or more write and read operations.
   Credentials transfer needs to be performed securely due to the
   sensitive nature of the information.

1.  Introduction

   Today, there is no standard way of transferring digital credentials
   securely between two devices belonging to the same platform or two
   different platforms.  This document proposes a solution to this
   problem by introducing a Relay server which allows devices to
   exchange encrypted Provisioning Information securely.  The Relay
   server solves this problem by creating and managing temporary mailbox
   storage.

   Each mailbox can be referenced by devices from a unique mailbox
   identifier in a URL.  The URL pointing to encrypted Provisioning
   Information is to be passed between devices directly over various
   channels (e.g.  SMS, email, messaging applications).  The exchange of
   the URL is outside of the scope of this document.

   This document describes a Hypertext (HTTP) Application Programming
   Interface (API) that allows Sender and Receiver devices to interact
   with a Relay server in order to perform secure credential transfer.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Security Considerations

   This section discusses security considerations for the protocol.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
